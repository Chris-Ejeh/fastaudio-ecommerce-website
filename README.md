# Frontend Mentor - fastaudio e-commerce website

[Design preview for the fastaudio e-commerce website coding challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a multi-page e-commerce website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Your users should be able to:
-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Add/Remove products from the cart
-   Edit product quantities in the cart
-   Fill in all fields in the checkout
-   Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
-   See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
    -   Shipping always adds $50 to the order
    -   VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
-   See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
-   **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
-   
### Built with

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
-   [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
-   GraphQL

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
